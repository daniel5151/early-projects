early-projects
==============

This repo is an archive of some of my earlier projects that I wrote when I was
just learning how to code. They're all thrown into a single repo since I started
them before I fully understood how Git worked haha. If you really want a
chuckle, check out the commit messages. They're... something alright.

While most of these projects are just small demos and half-finished clones of
games, a couple of them are actually pretty nifty little webapps:

- [physics](https://prilik.com/early-projects/physics)
  - A fun little physics sandbox that implements dampened elastic collisions
    from textbook equations.  It has a bunch a knobs and levers to tweak the
    simulation parameters, and a collection of "tools" to create and interact
    with the balls. It's quite basic, but it's still a surprisingly fun way to
    kill some time!
- [mp3](https://prilik.com/early-projects/mp3) and
  [mp3_2d](https://prilik.com/early-projects/mp3_2d)
  - an experiment with webaudio and three.js to visualize music / mic input.
- [conway](https://prilik.com/early-projects/conway)
  - a basic version of Conway's game of life
- [automa](https://prilik.com/early-projects/Automa)
  - a cellular automa simulator

I wouldn't recommend looking at the code... it's _not_ great. That said, I'm not
going to try and hide or embellish these early projects, since I think it's cool
to see just how far I've come since those early days (even if some of it is a
bit cringy at times).

This repo is also a fork of my main personal site's repo as-of Apr. 13th 2019.
When I first put up version 1 of my personal site, I wasn't well-versed in
proper repo hygiene, so I just left all my old project in the same repo as my
personal site. That obviously wasn't great, but I never seemed to find the time
to sit down and sort things out. Well, now I have, so if you visit
https://github.com/daniel5151/daniel5151.github.io, you should see a crisp,
clean commit history and repo.
