Hello,

Based on the information you provided, we are unable to confirm your identity or verify you as an authorized representative. In order for us to move forward with your impersonation report, we need some additional information.

Please provide us with the following:

A copy of your valid government-issued photo ID (e.g., driver's license, passport).
If you are being impersonated, provide documentary evidence, if available, that your legal name (that appears on the ID you send us) is connected to the name you are reporting (i.e., proof of registration of your trade name or pseudonym).
If you are an authorized representative, provide documentary evidence that you have authority to act on the impersonated individual's behalf (e.g., agent's agreement, power of attorney, documentation showing parental/guardianship rights of minor children).
If you are an authorized representative, provide copy of your business card.

Instructions:

Click on the link below to upload the requested document(s).
Be sure to send legible copies, as we need to be able to see the full name and photo on your ID and supplemental information. 
This information will be kept confidential and your documentation will be deleted.

Once we have received your documentation, we will review and process your report. 

Thank you,

Twitter

Hi,
Does it make a difference that I own the website prilik.ca where I host my resume and ordinal projects?

Hello,

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. It appears that you’re requesting a username rather than reporting an account that’s impersonating you. This form is only for reporting accounts that violate our impersonation policy.

In general, adding numbers, underscores or abbreviations can help you claim a great available username. To learn more about changing your username, see https://support.twitter.com/articles/14609.

Thanks,

Twitter
